# Revival-PVP Archive
This one of my early Minecraft projects. Together with a few guys from Germany we created a sub project from the **game-netz.de** called **Revival-PVP** with the domain **revival-pvp.de**.
This repository is the main repo for the main plugin of the server. It was a typical PVP server in Minecraft but we many modifications to mobs and loot. So it was PVP but the PVE was more challenging. 
The server went offline in January **2015** ‚è≤Ô∏è

Thank you all who were part of that project ü•≤ It was a great time
